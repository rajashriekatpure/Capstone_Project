## 1.Introduction
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. 

## 2. Objective:
The aim of this project is twofold: firstly, to delve into the data and uncover deeper insights that can help improve our understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of the first stage rocket landing. Secondly, to leverage this knowledge to build a robust machine learning pipeline capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful landing.
